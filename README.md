# Deneva's Portfolio

Hi, my name is Deneva Widyaningtyas

I'm a fresh graduate of Geological Engineering major, and recently I'm eager to learn about Data Science fields. Although my background is not IT, statistics, or math, I have a strong passion to continue learning outside of my field of study and deepen this data field. After graduate, I joined some data science bootcamp, and also did self-learning through several online platforms.

I'm really still a beginner, so I'm asking for corrections and suggestions for each project that I include in this portfolio, which is my first works ‚úåüèªüòÅ

# My Past Projects

This Github repository containing data science projects completed by me for self learning, and final project purposes. Mostly presented in the form of Python - Jupyter Notebooks.

## [Increasing Customer‚Äôs Acceptance in Marketing Campaign](https://github.com/denevawidya/Marketing_Campaign_Response)

This project was carried out to complete the final stage of the [Rakamin Academy Data Science Bootcamp](rakamin.com). The purpose is to predict the criteria of customer for accepting the next marketing campaign, using Supervised Learning models. All stages of work are completed with Guido's Team (6 people). 

## [Image Classification of Rocks, Papers, and Scissors](https://github.com/denevawidya/RPS_Image_Classification)

The purpose of this project is to classify and predict the hand images of Rock, Paper, or Scissors. This using artificial neural network with TensorFlowThis program.

## [Image Classification of Vehicles and Non-Vehicles](https://github.com/denevawidya/Vehicles_Image_Classification)

The purpose of this project is to develop a machine learning models for image classification of Vehicles and Non-Vehicles, after that converting the model into a TF-Lite file format that can be embedded in Android and iOS.

## [Time Series Models with LSTM](https://github.com/denevawidya/Time_Series_Model)

In this project I only tested the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models using a time series datasets containing monthly temperatures from Aomori City.
